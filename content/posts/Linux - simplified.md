This is a simple and compact summary on what linux is and how to use it. In this case I'll be talking about Ubuntu. 

## History Lesson

If we talk about Linux we usually mean operating systems which are based on the Linux kernel. The kernel was first released by Linus Torwalds. A kernel is the part of the operating system which talks to the hardware. Different distros have different supporting system software and libraries built using said kernel. 

A lot of this system software is provided by the GNU Project. GNU stands for "GNU's not Unix!" and is a big collaboration project for free software. The purpose of GNU was to replace everything Unix offers for free. 


> Free is not necessarily meant as in no cost. More so it is meant as without restriction to copy, edit and distribute said program.
