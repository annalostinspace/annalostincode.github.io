This is a simple and compact summary on what linux is and how to use it. In this case I'll be talking about Ubuntu. 

## History Lesson

If we talk about Linux we usually mean operating systems which are based on the Linux kernel. The kernel was first released by Linus Torwalds. A kernel is the part of the operating system which talks to the hardware. Different distros have different supporting system software and libraries built using said kernel. 

A lot of this system software is provided by the GNU Project. GNU stands for "GNU's not Unix!" and is a big collaboration project for free software. The purpose of GNU was to replace everything Unix offers for free. While GNU could run Unix programs it wasn't exactly the same and added some improvements like a crash proof file system. 

Utilities like `ls`, `grep` and `make` are all implemented both in GNU and Unix. We'll go into what those do later. 

> Free is not necessarily meant as in no cost. More so it is meant as without restriction to copy, edit and distribute said program. 

Linux was originally developed for personal computers. Nowadays it is also used for smartphones, servers, fridges and so on. It runs on more platforms than any other operating system.
